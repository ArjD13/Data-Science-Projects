Hello! Here you find brief introductions to data science projects I have completed as well as links to code necessary code and visuals accompanied with them. Hopefully you enjoy :-)

### Loan Classifcation Model deployed via into flask api

- Developed a random forest classification model that determines whether appplicants are approved or denied for Loans. 
- I looked at data containing, gender, area, applicant/co-applicant features to extract any sort of insights from the dataset. 
- After fine tuning and pickling the rf model, I created a flask API the takes in user input in the form of a json POST request. 
- The api will then return the probabilities of the json representing a random applicant being approved or denied.

### Flight Arrival Delay Predictor
 
- Attempted to create a regression model that examined US 2019 flight data to predict arrivals delay for the January 2020. 
- Looked at relationships between air traffic and flight origin/destination, flight haul, time of day and day of week flight departs/arrives at and other historical depature and arrival delays from well known busy airports.
> **Still working on pulling weather data to encoperate with the regression models, doing so as weather will hands down be the largest contributor to an arrival delay**
