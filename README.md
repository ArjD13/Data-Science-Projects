## Loan Classifcation Model deployed via into flask api

 Developed a random forest classification model that determines whether appplicants are approved or denied for Loans. Look at data containing, gender, area, applicant/co-applicant features After fine tuning and pickling the rf model, I created a flask API the takes in user input in the form of a json POST request for which the api returns the probabilities of the json representing a random applicant being approved or denied.
 
 ## Flight Arrival Delay Predicotr
 
 Attempted to create a regression model that examined US 2019 flight data to predict arrivals delay for the January 2020. Looked at relationships between air traffic and flight origin/destination, flight haul, time of day and day of week flight departs/arrives at and other historical depature and arrival delays from well known busy airports.
